Hi!

I'm Richard, but I go by **mox** or **moxnt** for some reason.
I like fast paced flashy stuff and writing software for convenience.
Currently *getting my education* stats up, but still *looking for opportunities* in the meantime.

moxnt/moxnt is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
